# Finding Employment as a (New) Programmer
{: .no_toc }

People have a wide variety of reasons for learning to code, and finding work as a programmer is one of the most common reasons. In the [ongoing survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSez7B3mKB9hmOKoiE7LS5ZmpaWME_KNOiLsznH4zb0UtSoxsA/viewform?usp=sf_link) I have posted, just over half of the people who've responded say that one of their goals is to find employment as a professional programmer.

People often ask what it takes to get hired as a programmer, and how long it will take to find a job. Answers to these kinds of questions depend on a lot of factors, and can't really be answered quickly.

This section looks at the kinds of work you can find as a programmer, and shares some specific steps you can take to find your first programming-related job. There are also some important aspects of the tech hiring process that you should be aware of, if you haven't read much about it already.
