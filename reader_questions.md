# Reader Questions
{: .no_toc }

I get questions from readers on a regular basis. Many of those are individual in nature, but many questions also come up often enough that it's worth sharing some of those answers more publicly, and in a little more depth than I can present in an email. These questions are organized by which section of the book they're most relevant to.

- Alien Invasion
  - [What is the role of `self` and `ai_game` in the code that creates the ship?](../reader_questions/ship_self/)
