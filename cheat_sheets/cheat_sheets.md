# Cheat Sheets

Cheat sheets can be really helpful when youâ€™re trying a set of exercises related to a specific topic, or working on a project. Because you can only fit so much information on a single sheet of paper, most cheat sheets are a simple listing of syntax rules. This set of cheat sheets aims to remind you of syntax rules, but also remind you of important concepts as well. You can click here and download [all of the original sheets in a single document](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/releases/download/v1.0.1/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_all.pdf).
