# Python

## Basics

* I can change the value of a var and python keeps track of the current value.
* var = letters, numbers, underscores only
* vars cannot start with a number
* vars = nospaces
* list = ["string0", "string1", 9, true, ["*", 5.5]]
* tuple is a list that retains sequence, cannot be changed after creation.

## Object Oriented Programming

* Every object is an instance of a class
