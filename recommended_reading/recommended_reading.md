# Recommended Reading
{: .no_toc }

People often ask what they should read after finishing Python Crash Course. This is a hard question to answer, because there are so many different directions you can go once you have a reasonable understanding of the basics of Python, and of programming in general. One of my clear goals in writing PCC was to set people up to be able to make sense of just about any intermediate text they pick up.

This section recommends a few first steps, and then offers a number of recommendations depending on what you're most interested in as a programmer.

I am really interested to hear from readers about which resources have worked well after PCC. I can't possibly keep up with everything that's available at the intermediate level, so if you have some recommendations please get in touch. I'm [@ehmatthes](https://twitter.com/ehmatthes) on Twitter, and my email is ehmatthes at gmail.
