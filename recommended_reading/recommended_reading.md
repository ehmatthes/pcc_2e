# Recommended Reading
{: .no_toc }

People often ask what they should read after finishing Python Crash Course. This is a hard question to answer, because there are so many different directions you can go once you have a reasonable understanding of the basics of Python, and of programming in general. One of my clear goals in writing PCC was to set people up to be able to make sense of just about any intermediate text they pick up.
