# First Steps

There are a few resources right here that you might find helpful, if you haven't already become familiar with them:

- Cheat Sheets
  - When you're working on your own projects or working through another learning resoource, this series of cheat sheets can save you some time flipping through the book to brush up on syntax and concepts you're still working to solidify. (I do this on every new project I start.)
- Challenges
  - The exercises in the book are pretty basic; they're meant to keep people from just nodding along and saying, "I get that". I am slowly building up a set of more challenging exericses to push people further in using what's covered in the book. Check out these challenges, and see if you find any of them interesting.
- Finding Employment
  - The other hard question I get asked a lot is, "How do I find a job as a programmer?" That's a hard question because there are so many different kinds of work you can do as a programmer, and because the job field is a complicated area. You might be interested in looking through this section.
