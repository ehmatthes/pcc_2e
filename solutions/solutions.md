# Solutions
{: .no_toc }

Solutions for selected exercises from each chapter can be found below. Be careful about looking at the solutions too quickly; make sure you've given yourself time to wrestle with the concepts you just learned before looking at a solution. Also, there are several ways to solve many of the exercises, and the solutions only show one possible way to complete each exercise.

I haven't included solutions for Chapters 12-14 and 18-20, because the exercises for those chapters are really projects in themselves. If you're having trouble with an exercise from one of those chapters consider posting on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/), or [get in touch](#questions).

- [Chapter 2](../chapter_2/)
- [Chapter 3](../chapter_3/)
- [Chapter 4](../chapter_4/)
- [Chapter 5](../chapter_5/)
- [Chapter 6](../chapter_6/)
- [Chapter 7](../chapter_7/)

The rest of the solutions will be posted shortly. If you need to see a solution now and it's not listed here, you can check the [solutions for the first edition](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/solutions/README.html). Many of the solutions have not changed, so you might find these helpful.
