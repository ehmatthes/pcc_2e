Resolve activating the virtual environment on page 381 (Chapter 18) of PCC2e


For Windows users, activating the virtual environment may not work if the ExecutionPolicy is restricted. To check your ExecutionPolicy settings, in an active terminal session, type 'Get-ExecutionPolicy' without the quotation marks and hit the enter key. If it shows 'Restricted', type 'Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process' (without the quotation marks) and hit enter. This then allows you to activate your virtual environment by using the command 'll_env\Scripts\activate' (without the quotation marks).
